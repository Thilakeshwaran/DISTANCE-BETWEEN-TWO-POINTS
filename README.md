# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
values assigned to the variables
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
solution is stored in one variable
### Step 5: 
print the output


### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,x2,y1,y2=10,4,6,2
dis=math.sqrt((pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2)))
print(round(dis,2))
```
